### Getting Started

An overview of GraphQL in general is available in the [README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the Specification for GraphQL.


This package is intended to help you building GraphQL schemas/types fast and easily.
+ Easy to use: GraphQL.jl helps you used GraphQL in Julia without effort.
+ Data agnostic: GraphQL.jl supports any type of data source: SQL, NoSQL, etc. The intent is to provide a complete API and make your data available through GraphQL.

### Using GraphQL.jl

GraphQL.jl provides two important capabilities: building a type schema, and serving queries against that type schema.
